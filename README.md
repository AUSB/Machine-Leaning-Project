# Machine-leaning-project

A project using Python to implement linear least squares regression to compare Empirical risk minimization (ERM) and Regularized least squares regression (RLM)

Used load function to load data from given text files and plot the outputs as a function of inputs
Computed the empirical square loss on the data and plot it as a function of degree for each learned function
Repeat the previous step using regularized least squares polynomial regression.
